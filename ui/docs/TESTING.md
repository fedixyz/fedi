# UI Testing Guide

This guide covers testing workflows for the Fedi UI codebase, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Quick Start

1. Start the development environment:

    ```bash
    just run-dev-ui
    ```

2. In the **dev** pane, press 't' to open testing utilities:
    ```
    UI Testing Utils: Select an option:
    a - run tests for all UI workspaces
    c - run tests for common workspace only
    n - run tests for native workspace only
    w - run tests for web workspace only
    e - run e2e tests
    b - back
    ```

## UI Workspace Tests

The UI is organized into workspaces with different types of tests:

### Workspace Structure

-   **`common/`** - Shared business logic, hooks, Redux state, and utilities
-   **`native/`** - React Native components and native mobile-specific logic
-   **`web/`** - React web components and web-specific logic

### Test Types

-   Unit Tests: For testing individual functions and components using mocks to minimize integration paths & cover more comprehensive edge cases / failure modes
-   Integration Tests: Interactions between multiple components or systems, often using the Remote Bridge

### Remote Bridge Integration

Many UI tests require a **Remote Bridge** connection to test real fedimint interactions. The test runner automatically handles this.

### Automatic Remote Bridge Management

The `run-ui-tests.sh` script detects if a remote bridge is already running:

-   **Bridge Running** (port 26722): Tests run against existing remote ridge
-   **No Bridge**: Starts a temporary remote bridge with dev federation, runs tests, then shuts down

### Integration Test Builder

For integration tests, use the `IntegrationTestBuilder` pattern:

```typescript
import { createIntegrationTestBuilder } from '@fedi/common/tests/utils/remote-bridge-setup'

describe('/path/to/file', () => {
    const builder = createIntegrationTestBuilder()
    const context = builder.getContext()

    it('should...', async () => {
        await builder.withOnboardingCompleted()
        ...
    })
})
```

To test hooks in common you can use the `renderHookWithBridge` custom render:

```typescript
import { createIntegrationTestBuilder } from '@fedi/common/tests/utils/remote-bridge-setup'
import { renderHookWithBridge } from '@fedi/common/tests/utils/render'

describe('/path/to/file', () => {
    const builder = createIntegrationTestBuilder()
    const context = builder.getContext()

    // Pass our remote bridge and store
    it('should...', async () => {
        const { bridge, store } = context

        const { result } = renderHookWithBridge(
            () => useHook(bridge, store),
            store,
            bridge,
        )
    })
})
```

Testing web components uses the pattern with a different render function:

```typescript
import { createIntegrationTestBuilder } from '@fedi/common/tests/utils/remote-bridge-setup'
import { renderWithBridge } from '@fedi/web/tests/utils/render'

describe('/path/to/file', () => {
    const builder = createIntegrationTestBuilder()
    const context = builder.getContext()

    // Pass our remote bridge and store
    it('should...', async () => {
       const { bridge, store } = context

       renderWithBridge(<EditProfilePage />, { store, fedimint })

       ...
    })
})
```

Testing native components also uses a custom render function but you need to pass a `waitFor` override to the test builder:

```typescript
import { waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native'
import { createIntegrationTestBuilder } from '@fedi/common/tests/utils/remote-bridge-setup'
import { renderWithBridge } from '@fedi/native/tests/utils/render'

describe('/path/to/file', () => {
    const builder = createIntegrationTestBuilder(waitFor) // Pass waitFor override
    const context = builder.getContext()

    // Pass our remote bridge and store
    it('should...', async () => {
       const { bridge, store } = context

       renderWithBridge(<EditProfilePage />, { store, fedimint })

       ...
    })
})
```

#### Available Builder Methods

-   `withOnboardingCompleted()` - Completes user onboarding with new seed
-   `withFederationJoined()` - Joins a test federation (calls withOnboardingCompleted() automatically)
-   `withChatReady()` - Sets up Matrix authentication for chat (calls withOnboardingCompleted() automatically)
-   `withChatGroupCreated()` - Creates a chat group for testing (calls withOnboardingCompleted() automatically)
-   `withEcashReceived(amount)` - Receives ecash to test wallet functionality (calls withFederationJoined() automatically)

### Manual Bridge Control

To run tests against your own bridge setup:

1. Start bridge manually:

    ```bash
    cd scripts/bridge && ./run-remote.sh --with-devfed
    ```

2. Run tests (will detect running bridge):
    ```bash
    # From dev-ui-utils testing menu
    a - run tests for all UI workspaces
    ```

## Test Commands

### Via Testing Menu

Access through development environment:

```bash
just run-dev-ui  # Then press 't' in dev pane
```

### Running Specific Test Files

You can run all unit tests or all integration tests within a workspace by running the `test:unit` or `test:integration` scripts:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

or

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

To run a specific test file, you can use the `test:unit` or `test:integration` scripts with the filename added:

`cd` into the workspace you want to test and run:

```bash
yarn test:unit filename
```

or

```bash
yarn test:integration filename
```

## Test Configuration

Tests use Jest with custom test environments and utilities:

### Common Test Utilities

-   `renderHookWithState()` - Render React hooks with Redux state
-   `createMockFedimintBridge()` - Mock fedimint interactions
-   `mockInitializeCommonStore()` - Set up Redux store for testing
-   Mock factories for transactions, Matrix events, federations

### Test Environment

Custom Jest environment combining Node.js and jsdom for testing both business logic and React components.

## End-to-End Tests

For mobile app testing with real devices/simulators, see the dedicated E2E documentation:

**[ðŸ“± E2E Testing Guide](../native/tests/README.md)**

## Best Practices

### Test Organization

-   **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/components in isolation
-   **Integration tests**: Test interactions between multiple parts
-   **E2E tests**: Test complete UIUX flows on fully simulated devices

### Remote Bridge Tests

-   Use `IntegrationTestBuilder` for complex multi-step scenarios
-   Tests automatically handle bridge setup/teardown, each `it` statement gets its initialized bridge + device ID
-   For pure unit tests with many `it` statements, consider using `createMockFedimintBridge` if a full remote bridge is not required, but an integration tes may be more suitable depending on what you are testing

### Test Data

-   Use factory functions (`createMockTransaction`, `createMockPaymentEvent`, etc.)
-   Avoid hardcoded test data
-   Use realistic data structures matching production types

### Performance

-   Integration tests have longer timeouts (10-60 seconds)
-   Use `waitFor()` for async state changes
-   Clean up resources in `afterEach` hooks

## Troubleshooting

### Remote Bridge Issues

```bash
# Check if remote bridge is running
lsof -i:26722

# Kill stuck bridge process
pkill -f "remote-bridge"

# Reset and restart
scripts/ui/run-ui-tests.sh
```

### Test Failures

-   Check that dev federation is running properly
-   Ensure no conflicting processes on required ports
-   Review test timeouts for slow operations
-   Try restarting the remote bridge
