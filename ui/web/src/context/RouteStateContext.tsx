/**
 * @file
 * This context allows us to push the user to routes with hidden state attached,
 * accessed via a React context. This is very similar to React-Native's
 * navigation state (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-state/)
 *
 * This had to be a custom solution since Next.js typically wants you to carry
 * state to routes in the form of query parameters for improved server side
 * rendering, but we don't want to do this for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Some of the data here is dangerously large to be put into query parameters
 *    for fear of limits. For instance, LNURL pay can have arbitrarily sized
 *    metadata attached.
 * 2. From a privacy perspective, we do not want users accessing routes with
 *    query parameters that may provide identifying information. Including a
 *    federation id, bolt11 invoice, chat identities etc. in the query param
 *    could have it sent to the server and ending up in logs.
 *
 * This state is lost if the user manually navigates or refreshes to a page.
